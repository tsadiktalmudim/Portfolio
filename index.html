        </div>
        <div>
            <p>First and foremost, I am a father of five and a husband to my gorgeous wife. Secondly, I love all things food and music. Fermentation and experimentation are my favorite things in the kitchen and the latter, in the music room. Thirdly, I have
                experience in many fields, including oilfield, construction, IT, IT management, restaurant management, and more.</p>
            <p>With a highly-varied resume and overflow of work experience, including restaurant management, oilfield management, construction, etc., my horizons have been expanded on all fronts; personally, professionally, spiritually, etc. With that comes
                a high work ethic, eye for detail and requirement for perfection that serves me well in all of those areas.</p>
